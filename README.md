# TranslateLib

## What happened to GTLNMTL?

You might be coming here from Google Translate for LNMTL, and you may wonder why I stopped development of GTLNMTL and switched to TranslateLib.
The reason is simple, I've improved myself and I am ready to attempt a bigger and better project. This project was also partly inspired from lightnovel-crawler.

## What is TranslateLib

TranslateLib is a more general version of GTLNMTL and adds support for future alternative translation providers. It also has all the goodies of GTLNMTL and will
continue to improve in the future.

To be more specific, TranslateLib provides the groundwork for alternative translation providers. TranslateLib uses ES6 features heavily and has a cleaner codebase than Google Translate.
It's also completely opensourced with the GNU Public License.

# Contribution

Feel free to contact me at discord, you can find me in the LNMTL discord or add me directly @MMTF#1934

I realize that the code is not very beautiful. But I hope to receive you guys' help in making it better, and making it easier for others to add providers.

As of yet, there isn't any contribution guide, so feel free to make pull requests and I'll review them and accordingly merge them.
Also feel free to create new issues. (Do not create issues about Google Translate exceeding the usage quota. This is an issue that _might_ be fixed in the future.)
